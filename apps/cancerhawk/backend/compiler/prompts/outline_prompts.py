REQUIRED SECTION STRUCTURE (MANDATORY):
Your outline MUST include these sections in this exact order:

1. **Abstract** - OPTIONAL (if included, appears first; brief summary written last during construction)
2. **Introduction** - Background, motivation, problem statement, and roadmap (REQUIRED)
3. **Body Sections** - Main content (numbered II, III, IV, etc.) covering:
   - Preliminaries/Definitions
   - Main Results/Theorems
   - Proofs
   - Additional analysis as needed
4. **Conclusion** - Summary of findings and implications (always the LAST content section) (REQUIRED)

STRICT NAMING REQUIREMENTS:
- The section named "Abstract" is OPTIONAL - if included, can use "Abstract", "I. Abstract", or "0. Abstract"
- The section named "Introduction" MUST use exactly that word: "Introduction" (or "I. Introduction") - REQUIRED
- The section named "Conclusion" MUST use exactly that word: "Conclusion" (or "N. Conclusion" where N is the last Roman numeral) - REQUIRED
- Body sections between Introduction and Conclusion can be flexibly named (e.g., "II. Preliminaries", "III. Main Results")

🔍 CORRECT OUTLINE FORMATS (THREE VALID OPTIONS):

**Option 1 - With Abstract (unnumbered, recommended):**

```
Abstract

I. Introduction
   A. Historical context of circle-squaring problem
   B. Statement of impossibility
   C. Overview of proof approach

II. Preliminaries and Definitions
   A. Compass and straightedge constructions
   B. Field extensions and constructible numbers

III. Main Theoretical Results
   A. Theorem: Characterization of constructible lengths
   B. Theorem: Lindemann-Weierstrass (transcendence of π)

IV. Proofs
   A. Proof of constructibility characterization
   B. Lindemann-Weierstrass proof outline

V. Conclusion
   A. Summary of impossibility result
   B. Historical significance
```

**Option 2 - With Abstract (numbered):**

```
I. Abstract

II. Introduction
   A. Historical context
   ...

III. Preliminaries
   ...

VI. Conclusion
   ...
```

OR with zero-based numbering:

```
0. Abstract

I. Introduction
   ...

V. Conclusion
   ...
```

**Option 3 - Without Abstract (also valid):**

```
I. Introduction
   A. Historical context
   ...

II. Preliminaries
   ...

V. Conclusion
   ...
```

❌ WRONG FORMATS - DO NOT DO THESE:

1. WRONG: Using descriptive text instead of proper section names
   ```
   Summary of the paper's core contribution...  ❌ NO - Use "Abstract" or start with "Introduction"
   ```

2. WRONG: Incorrect Abstract format (if including it)
   ```
   Abstract: This paper explores...  ❌ NO - Just "Abstract" (no colon or content)
   Summary  ❌ NO - Must be "Abstract" if including this section
   ```

3. WRONG: Adding content under "Abstract" in the outline
   ```
   Abstract
   This paper establishes...  ❌ NO - Outline lists sections only, not content
   ```

The outline is a TABLE OF CONTENTS showing section names and subsections. It does NOT contain the actual paper content.

YOUR TASK:
SOURCE USAGE PRINCIPLE:
- Treat the aggregator/brainstorm database as optional high-value source material and exploration history, not a mandatory checklist
- Use it when it helps you achieve the strongest rigorous paper for the user's compiler-directing prompt
- You may selectively synthesize, extend, or depart from brainstorm/database material if that better serves the paper
- Do NOT force coverage of every brainstorm/database entry
- Do NOT ignore clearly crucial source material for the scope you choose

- Produce a numbered outline with major sections and subsections
- Incorporate the strongest helpful source ideas where appropriate
- Flag gaps explicitly if the evidence is insufficient
- Reference supporting content from the aggregator database where appropriate, but do not mirror it mechanically
- Ensure outline supports a coherent, logical flow for the final mathematical document
- Replace unsupported empirical result claims with neutral headings such as "Evaluation Plan", "Proposed Validation", or "Expected Runtime Benefits"

ITERATIVE REFINEMENT PROCESS:
This is an iterative outline creation phase. You may submit multiple versions:

1. Generate your best outline based on the user prompt, your chosen paper scope, and any helpful source material from the aggregator database
2. The validator will review and provide detailed feedback (accept or reject)
3. If accepted: Review feedback - you can still refine further OR mark outline_complete=true
4. If rejected: Review feedback and generate improved outline
5. You will see feedback from your last 5 submissions below

VALIDATOR FEEDBACK YOU WILL RECEIVE:
- Whether your previous submission was accepted or rejected
- Detailed reasoning about structure, completeness, alignment with user prompt
- Specific areas to improve (missing content, structural issues, etc.)
- Actionable suggestions for refinement

WHEN TO MARK outline_complete=true (LOCK OUTLINE):
- The outline makes strong use of any source material it chooses to use and does not omit clearly crucial material for its chosen scope
- Required sections (Abstract, Introduction, Body, Conclusion) present with exact names
- Sections follow logical mathematical progression (definitions → theorems → proofs)
- The outline optimally serves the paper title and user's compiler-directing prompt
- No further refinement would meaningfully improve the outline
- You are confident this outline will guide excellent paper construction

WHEN TO MARK outline_complete=false (CONTINUE REFINING):
- After reviewing validator feedback, you see opportunities for improvement
- Clearly crucial source material or supporting structure is still missing
- Structural organization could be enhanced
- Subsection granularity needs adjustment
- You want to incorporate more useful brainstorm/database material
- You want to incorporate validator suggestions before locking

HARD LIMIT:
If you do not mark outline_complete=true within 15 iterations, the outline will be force-completed automatically. Aim to finalize within reasonable iterations.

CRITICAL - SYSTEM-MANAGED MARKERS (NOT YOUR OUTPUT):

During outline creation, the CURRENT OUTLINE may contain a system-managed anchor marker:
- [HARD CODED END-OF-OUTLINE MARK -- ALL OUTLINE CONTENT SHOULD BE ABOVE THIS LINE]

This anchor is added by the system (outline_memory.py), NOT by you.

**YOU MUST NEVER OUTPUT THIS MARKER IN YOUR OUTLINE SUBMISSIONS**

If you include placeholder markers like "[HARD CODED PLACEHOLDER FOR...]" or anchor markers in your outline submission, it will be rejected. All outline content must be actual section/subsection names and descriptions.

The validator checks YOUR SUBMISSION for placeholder text, not the existing outline structure.

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- The outline MUST include: Introduction, at least one Body section, and Conclusion (Abstract is optional)
- Clearly crucial source material for the chosen scope should have a place in the outline, but you do NOT need to mirror every brainstorm/database entry
- The outline should support a coherent, logical flow for the final document
- Sections should build upon each other logically (definitions → theorems → proofs)
- The outline should align with the user's compiler-directing prompt goals
- DO NOT include a separate References or Citations section in the outline
- All content must be rooted in sound mathematical reasoning; aggregator/brainstorm material is optional support, not a mandatory checklist
- NO unfounded claims or logical fallacies
- Focus on rigorous mathematical arguments
- DO NOT include unsupported numeric empirical claims in section or subsection headings

The validator will REJECT your outline if:
- Missing required sections: Introduction or Conclusion
- Section names don't match exactly (e.g., "Summary" instead of "Conclusion", "Overview" instead of "Introduction")
- If Abstract is included, it must use proper format: "Abstract", "I. Abstract", or "0. Abstract" (not descriptive text)
- Sections are out of order (e.g., Conclusion before body sections)
- No body sections between Introduction and Conclusion
- The outline includes unsupported benchmark-style numbers or hardware results as if already established

CRITICAL - HOW TO FIX COMMON REJECTION:
If validator says "MISSING_REQUIRED_SECTION: Introduction", ensure you have a line with "Introduction" or "I. Introduction".

Abstract is OPTIONAL - you can include it ("Abstract", "I. Abstract", or "0. Abstract") or omit it entirely.

Output your response ONLY as JSON in this exact format:
{
  "content": "Your complete outline with sections and subsections",
  "outline_complete": true OR false,
  "reasoning": "Explanation of outline structure AND completion decision"
}

⚠️ CRITICAL - USE ONLY THESE 3 FIELDS FOR OUTLINE CREATE MODE:
You MUST use EXACTLY these 3 fields: "content", "outline_complete", "reasoning"

DO NOT use these fields (they are for a DIFFERENT mode called outline_update):
- "operation" ❌ WRONG
- "old_string" ❌ WRONG  
- "new_string" ❌ WRONG
- "needs_update" ❌ WRONG

CRITICAL - outline_complete FIELD:
- Set to FALSE if you want to refine the outline further after reviewing validator feedback
- Set to TRUE when outline is final and ready to lock for paper construction
- This field is REQUIRED for outline_create mode (must be present)

CRITICAL - "content" FIELD STRUCTURE:
Your outline can start with Abstract (optional) or Introduction (required).
Examples: 
- With Abstract: "content": "Abstract\\n\\nI. Introduction\\n..."
- With numbered Abstract: "content": "I. Abstract\\n\\nII. Introduction\\n..."
- Without Abstract: "content": "I. Introduction\\n..."

REQUIRED SECTION STRUCTURE (MUST BE PRESERVED):
The outline MUST maintain these exact sections in this exact order:
1. **Abstract** - Brief summary (exactly "Abstract")
2. **Introduction** - Background and roadmap (exactly "Introduction" or "I. Introduction")
3. **Body Sections** - Main content (numbered II, III, IV, etc.)
4. **Conclusion** - Summary of findings (exactly "Conclusion" or "N. Conclusion")

YOUR TASK:
SOURCE USAGE PRINCIPLE:
- Treat the aggregator/brainstorm database as optional support, not a mandatory checklist
- Update the outline if source material would materially strengthen the paper
- Do NOT force additions just because a brainstorm/database entry exists
- Do NOT ignore clearly crucial source material for the scope you are keeping

Decide if the outline requires updates. Consider:
- Relevance to current source content when it helps the paper
- Missing content that should be included in outline to better serve the user prompt
- Structural issues in current outline
- Alignment with document construction progress

CRITICAL - NO PLACEHOLDER TEXT:
You must NEVER include placeholder markers like "[HARD CODED PLACEHOLDER FOR...]" in your outline submissions.
All outline content must be actual section/subsection names and descriptions, not placeholder text.

WHEN TO UPDATE THE OUTLINE (ADDITIONS ONLY):
- Clearly important source content or a better structure is missing from current outline
- Document construction reveals needed additional sections
- New pertinent information from source material or rigorous synthesis should be added to better serve the user-prompt title
- Unsupported empirical claims should be converted into cautious evaluation-plan sections rather than asserted-results sections

CRITICAL: You can ONLY ADD to the outline, NOT delete or remove existing sections.
CRITICAL: New body sections MUST be inserted BEFORE the Conclusion section.

WHEN NOT TO UPDATE:
- Current outline already serves the paper well even if some brainstorm/database items remain unused
- No new relevant content needs to be added

CRITICAL - SYSTEM-MANAGED MARKERS (NOT YOUR OUTPUT):

During outline updates, the CURRENT OUTLINE may contain a system-managed anchor marker:
- [HARD CODED END-OF-OUTLINE MARK -- ALL OUTLINE CONTENT SHOULD BE ABOVE THIS LINE]

This anchor is added by the system (outline_memory.py), NOT by you.

**YOU MUST NEVER OUTPUT THIS MARKER IN YOUR OUTLINE SUBMISSIONS**

If you include placeholder markers like "[HARD CODED PLACEHOLDER FOR...]" or anchor markers in your outline submission, it will be rejected. All outline content must be actual section/subsection names and descriptions.

The validator checks YOUR SUBMISSION for placeholder text, not the existing outline structure.

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR UPDATES:
- All added content must be rooted in sound mathematical reasoning; source database material is optional support, not a mandatory checklist
- NO unfounded claims or logical fallacies
- Focus on rigorous mathematical arguments
- NEVER change the names of Abstract, Introduction, or Conclusion sections
- New body sections must be inserted between Introduction and Conclusion
- DO NOT add unsupported numeric empirical claims in section or subsection headings

EXACT STRING MATCHING FOR EDITS:
If updating, this system uses EXACT STRING MATCHING. You must:
1. Find the exact text in the current outline where you want to insert
2. Copy that exact text (including whitespace and newlines) as old_string
3. Provide your new sections/subsections as new_string
4. Use operation="insert_after" to add after an anchor point

OPERATIONS:
- "insert_after": Find old_string exactly (anchor), insert new_string after it (most common for adding sections)
- "replace": Find old_string exactly, replace with new_string (for fixing section names)

UNIQUENESS REQUIREMENT:
- old_string MUST be unique in the outline
- Include enough context to ensure uniqueness (e.g., full section header with subsections)

If you decide NO update is needed, set "needs_update" to false and leave old_string and new_string empty.

Output your response ONLY as JSON in this exact format:
{
  "needs_update": true or false,
  "operation": "insert_after | replace",
  "old_string": "exact text from outline to find (anchor point, empty if needs_update=false)",
  "new_string": "new sections/subsections to add (empty if needs_update=false)",

⚠️ CRITICAL - OUTLINE CREATE MODE USES ONLY THESE 3 FIELDS:
- "content" - Your complete outline text (can start with Abstract [optional] or Introduction [required])
- "outline_complete" - true or false
- "reasoning" - Your explanation

❌ DO NOT USE THESE FIELDS IN OUTLINE CREATE MODE:
- "operation" - WRONG (this is for outline_update mode ONLY)
- "old_string" - WRONG (this is for outline_update mode ONLY)
- "new_string" - WRONG (this is for outline_update mode ONLY)
- "needs_update" - WRONG (this is for outline_update mode ONLY)

If you include operation/old_string/new_string fields, your submission will be REJECTED.

CRITICAL - outline_complete FIELD:
- Set to FALSE if you want to refine the outline further after reviewing validator feedback
- Set to TRUE when outline is final and ready to lock for paper construction
- This field is REQUIRED for outline_create mode (must be present)

REQUIRED JSON FORMAT (for outline update):
{
  "needs_update": true OR false,
  "operation": "insert_after | replace",
  "old_string": "exact text from outline (anchor point, empty if needs_update=false)",
  "new_string": "new sections to add (empty if needs_update=false)",
  "reasoning": "string - explanation of decision"
}

MANDATORY SECTION STRUCTURE:
Every outline MUST contain these sections with EXACT names in this order:
1. Abstract (exactly "Abstract")
2. Introduction (exactly "Introduction" or "I. Introduction")
3. Body sections (II, III, IV, etc. - flexible naming)
4. Conclusion (exactly "Conclusion" or "N. Conclusion")

✅ CORRECT Example (Iteration 2 - Continue Refining):
{
  "content": "Abstract\\n\\nI. Introduction\\n   A. Historical context\\n   B. Problem statement\\n\\nII. Preliminaries\\n   A. Basic definitions\\n   B. Constructible numbers\\n\\nIII. Main Results\\n   A. Theorem 1: Characterization\\n   B. Theorem 2: Transcendence of pi\\n\\nIV. Conclusion",
  "outline_complete": false,
  "reasoning": "Outline structure improved based on validator feedback. Added Problem statement subsection under Introduction. However, validator noted missing coverage of Galois theory connections (submission 11) and Baker's theorem (submissions 8, 12). Will add these in next iteration before marking complete."
}

Note: The "content" field can start with "Abstract" (optional) or "Introduction" (required).

❌ WRONG - DO NOT DO THIS:
{
  "operation": "full_content",
  "new_string": "Abstract\\n\\nI. Introduction\\n...",
  "content": "I. Introduction\\n...",
  "outline_complete": false
}

This is WRONG because:
1. Uses "operation" field (only for outline_update mode, NOT outline_create)
2. Uses "new_string" field (only for outline_update mode, NOT outline_create)
3. "content" field has incorrect structure (must start with Abstract [optional] or Introduction [required])

Example (Iteration 6 - Ready to Lock):
{

}

CRITICAL JSON ESCAPE RULES:
1. Backslashes: ALWAYS use double backslash (\\\\) for any backslash in your text
   - Example: Write "\\\\tau" not "\\tau", write "\\\\(" not "\\("
2. Quotes: Escape double quotes inside strings as \\"
   - Example: "He said \\"hello\\"" 
3. Newlines/Tabs: Use \\n for newlines (NOT \\\\n), \\t for tabs (NOT \\\\t)
   - Example: "Line 1\\nLine 2" creates two lines
4. DO NOT use single backslashes except for: \\", \\\\, \\/, \\b, \\f, \\n, \\r, \\t, \\uXXXX
5. LaTeX notation: If your content contains mathematical expressions like \\Delta, \\tau, etc., 
   you MUST escape the backslash: write "\\\\Delta", "\\\\tau", "\\\\[", "\\\\]"

Example (Outline Update - No update needed):
{
  "needs_update": false,
  "operation": "insert_after",
  "old_string": "",
  "new_string": "",
  "reasoning": "The current outline already serves the paper well. The strongest useful material from the aggregator database is already represented, and no additional source content is necessary for this scope."

Example (Outline Update - Adding subsection under Section II):
{
  "needs_update": true,
  "operation": "insert_after",
  "old_string": "   C. Algebraic vs. transcendental numbers",
  "new_string": "\\n   D. Connection to Galois theory\\n      1. Field automorphisms and constructibility\\n      2. Relationship to solvability by radicals",
  "reasoning": "The aggregator database contains important Galois theory connections not yet in the outline. Inserting after subsection C to add new subsection D under Section II."
