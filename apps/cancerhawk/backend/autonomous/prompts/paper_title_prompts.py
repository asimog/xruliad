⚠️ CRITICAL - INTERNAL CONTENT WARNING ⚠️

ALL context provided to you (brainstorm databases, accepted submissions, papers, reference materials, outlines, previous document content) is AI-GENERATED within this research system. This content has NOT been peer-reviewed, published, or verified by external sources.

YOU MUST TREAT ALL PROVIDED CONTEXT WITH EXTREME SKEPTICISM:
- NEVER assume claims are true because they "sound good" or "fit well"
- NEVER trust information simply because it appears in "accepted submissions" or "papers"
- ALWAYS verify information independently before using or building upon it
- NEVER cite internal documents as authoritative or established sources
- Question and validate every assertion, even if it appears in validated content

 The internal context shows what has been explored by AI agents, NOT what has been proven correct. Your role is to generate rigorous, verifiable mathematical content. Use internal context as exploration history and your base knowledge for reasoning and verification.

 WHEN IN DOUBT: Verify independently. Do not assume. Do not trust unverified internal context as truth.

---

YOUR TASK:
Choose a title that accurately captures the mathematical content and scope of the planned paper.

IMPORTANT CLARIFICATION:
- The brainstorm submissions are the SOURCE MATERIAL for your paper
- Your title SHOULD reflect what's in the brainstorm - that's expected and correct!
- You only need to differentiate from EXISTING COMPLETED PAPERS from this brainstorm
- If "EXISTING PAPERS FROM THIS BRAINSTORM: None" - there's nothing to differentiate from

TITLE CRITERIA:
- Accurately represents the mathematical content to be covered (from your brainstorm)
- Is specific enough to convey the paper's focus
- Is professional and suitable for a mathematical research paper
- Differentiates from EXISTING COMPLETED PAPERS from the same brainstorm (if any exist - check the list below)
- Avoids being overly broad or generic

TITLE STYLE:
- Use standard mathematical paper title conventions
- Can include colons for subtitles if appropriate
- Should convey the main mathematical themes
- Consider including key mathematical objects/concepts
- Appropriate length: typically 5-15 words

CRITICAL JSON ESCAPE RULES:
1. Backslashes: ALWAYS use double backslash (\\\\) for any backslash in your text
   - Example: Write "\\\\tau" not "\\tau"
2. Quotes: Escape double quotes inside strings as \\"
3. Newlines/Tabs: Use \\n for newlines, \\t for tabs

Output your title ONLY as JSON in the required format."""

EXAMPLE:

⚠️ CRITICAL DISTINCTION - DO NOT CONFUSE THESE:

1. **BRAINSTORM SUBMISSIONS** (in "BRAINSTORM SUMMARY") = The SOURCE MATERIAL for the paper.
   - These are the raw research insights that will be compiled INTO the paper
   - The paper title SHOULD reflect this content - that's the whole point!
   - DO NOT reject a title for being "similar to brainstorm submissions"
   - The title should CAPTURE what's in the brainstorm - similarity is EXPECTED and CORRECT

2. **EXISTING PAPERS FROM THIS BRAINSTORM** = Previously completed Tier 2 papers
   - These are FINISHED papers that already exist in the paper library
   - If this shows "None" - there are NO papers to differentiate from
   - ONLY reject for similarity if there ARE existing papers listed here
   - A title being similar to brainstorm content is NOT the same as being similar to existing papers

---

YOUR TASK:
Validate whether the proposed title is appropriate for the paper.

VALIDATION CRITERIA:

ACCEPT the title if:
- It accurately represents the brainstorm content (this is EXPECTED - the paper is based on the brainstorm!)
- It remains consistent with the paper's intended scope when selected reference papers are present
- It is appropriately specific (not too broad or narrow)
- It differentiates from EXISTING COMPLETED PAPERS from the same brainstorm (if any exist)
- It follows mathematical paper title conventions
- The reasoning is sound
- If "EXISTING PAPERS FROM THIS BRAINSTORM: None" - there's nothing to differentiate from, so accept if other criteria are met

REJECT the title if:
- It is too similar to an EXISTING COMPLETED PAPER from the same brainstorm (NOT brainstorm submissions - those are the source material!)
- It doesn't accurately represent the brainstorm content
- It is too vague or generic
- It doesn't follow professional conventions
- The reasoning is flawed

DO NOT REJECT simply because the title reflects brainstorm submission content - that is the INTENDED behavior.

CRITICAL JSON ESCAPE RULES:
1. Backslashes: ALWAYS use double backslash (\\\\) for any backslash in your text
2. Quotes: Escape double quotes inside strings as \\"
3. Newlines/Tabs: Use \\n for newlines, \\t for tabs
