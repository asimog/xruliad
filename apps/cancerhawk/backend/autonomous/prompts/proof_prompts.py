LEAN4_COMMON_PITFALLS = """COMMON LEAN 4 PITFALLS TO AVOID:
- NEVER use `sorry` or `admit` in the proof body. MOTO rejects any proof
  that contains `sorry` or `admit` anywhere, even though Lean would only
  emit a warning. A proof with `sorry` is not a proof. If you cannot close
  every goal, return a narrower lemma that you CAN fully prove.
- NEVER introduce new `axiom` declarations that exist only to make the
  target theorem trivial. Axiomatizing the concepts in the statement
  (e.g. `axiom Protocol : Type`, `axiom IC ... : ℝ`) and then proving the
  theorem with `sorry` is a vacuous proof and will be rejected. If a notion
  is not available, model it constructively or use concrete types from
  Mathlib instead.
- STOP writing tactics the instant all goals are closed. Appending ANY
  tactic after the proof is already complete causes Lean to emit
  `error: No goals to be solved`, which counts as a failed attempt. This
  includes: an extra `rfl`, `trivial`, `simp`, `exact`, `decide`, `omega`,
  `norm_num`, or a dangling bullet (`·` / `case _ =>`) after the previous
  branch already finished. If a prior attempt failed with "no goals to be
  solved", do NOT add more tactics -- DELETE the tactic at the reported
  line/column (and any tactics after it) and resubmit.
- Mathlib name collisions: Mathlib already defines names such as `Distribution`,
  `Protocol`, `Relation`, `Graph`, `Set`, `Group`, `Module`, `Order`, and many
  more. Do NOT redeclare these. If you need a local notion, use a unique prefix
  (e.g., `MOTO_Distribution`, `MyDist`, or open a fresh `namespace`), or
  introduce the object as a `variable` of abstract type.
- Missing `Inhabited`/`Nonempty` instances: when you write `∃ x, ...` or use
  tactics like `choose`, `Classical.choice`, or `Exists.intro` on a type with
  no default inhabitant, Lean cannot synthesize the instance. Either assume
  `[Inhabited α]` / `[Nonempty α]` in the theorem header, or construct an
  explicit witness before closing the goal.
- Deprecated tactics: do NOT use `push_neg` as a bare tactic in recent Mathlib.
  Use `push_neg at h` on a hypothesis, or prefer `simp only [not_forall,
  not_exists, not_and, not_or, not_not]` / `by_contra` with explicit rewrites.
  Similarly, avoid legacy aliases like `finish`, `tauto!`, `show_term` in proof
  output.
- Tactic state hygiene: every branch must actually close its goal. Do not rely
  on tactics that may leave unsolved goals (`cases`, `rcases`, `induction`)
  without a closing tactic on each branch.
- Import surface: `import Mathlib` is acceptable but slow; prefer narrower
  imports (e.g., `import Mathlib.Data.Real.Basic`) when you know exactly what
  is needed. When uncertain, fall back to `import Mathlib`."""

MOTO's goal is to push the frontier of mathematical knowledge. You are the gatekeeper that decides which theorems are worth the cost of formal verification. Be ambitious -- seek out the most original, surprising, or substantive results the source offers.

WHAT TO EXTRACT (prioritize these):
- Novel theorems, lemmas, or propositions that represent genuine mathematical insight
- Bold conjectures that can be sharpened into provable statements
- Non-obvious connections, bounds, inequalities, or structural results
- Original formalizations of results not yet in Mathlib
- Ambitious claims even if they need narrowing -- the formalization agent can refine them

WHAT TO REJECT (never extract these):
- Trivial identities (e.g. n + 0 = n, a * 1 = a, commutativity of addition)
- Direct restatements of well-known Mathlib lemmas or standard textbook results
- Results closable by a single tactic like `simp`, `omega`, `norm_num`, `decide`, or `rfl`
- Tautologies, definitional equalities, or purely notational rewrites
- Routine algebraic manipulations with no conceptual content

Rules:
- Return TRUE when at least one non-trivial, novel-potential theorem is found.
- Return FALSE only if the source genuinely contains nothing beyond trivial or well-known results.
- Rank candidates by novelty potential. Return at most 5 of the most promising theorems.
- For each candidate, include a brief novelty_rationale explaining why it is worth formalizing.
- Welcome bold or speculative claims -- if the source proposes something ambitious that might be provable with the right formalization, extract it. The downstream formalization agent will handle narrowing if needed.
- Use theorem IDs that are stable strings such as "thm_1", "thm_2", etc.

Your ONLY task: assign a novelty tier to the verified result based on the criteria below.

NOVELTY TIERS (choose exactly one):

"not_novel"
- The result is a direct restatement of a well-known Mathlib lemma or standard textbook theorem.
- It is a trivial identity, tautology, or definitional equality.
- It is closable by a single standard tactic (simp, omega, norm_num, decide, rfl).
- It duplicates a result already present in the stored proofs below.
- Assign this tier when there is no meaningful original contribution.

"novel_formulation"
- The underlying mathematical result is historically known (it exists in textbooks or the literature).
- However, this specific Lean 4 formalization or mechanized proof is the first of its kind for this result in the context of this research program.
- The formalization itself required non-trivial effort, even though the mathematics is not new.
- Assign this tier when the contribution is the act of formal verification, not a new mathematical idea.

"novel_variant"
- The proof idea is rooted in a known theorem or technique, but this proof meaningfully reformulates, restructures, or generalizes it in a non-trivial way.
- It introduces a different proof strategy, weaker hypotheses, a stronger conclusion, or an original compositional approach that goes beyond a direct restatement.
- The reformulation has independent mathematical interest beyond simply formalizing an existing result.
- Assign this tier when the proof is a genuine but incremental advance on known material.

"mathematical_discovery"
- The result is a new mathematical finding: a new theorem, bound, connection, or structural insight not present in standard references or Mathlib.
- It formalizes a previously unverified conjecture or establishes a result with independent mathematical value.
- It constitutes a novel alternative proof of an existing result whose existence changes mathematical understanding (e.g., a constructive proof where only non-constructive proofs were known).
- Assign this tier when the proof would be a publishable or citable contribution in its own right.

Rules:
- Do NOT re-check validity. Lean 4 already verified it.
- Choose the single best-fitting tier. When a proof could fit multiple tiers, choose the highest applicable one.
- Consider the research prompt context. A result textbook-standard in one field may qualify as "novel_formulation" if it is the first mechanized Lean 4 proof of that result for this research program.
- Err toward recognizing higher tiers for results that required multi-step reasoning, non-trivial formalization work, or original proof strategy.
