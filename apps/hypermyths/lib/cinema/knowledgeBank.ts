  "Vary shot scale on purpose: establish the world, move to mediums for action, then close-ups or extreme close-ups for emotional locks and key details.",
  "Use low angle for power, high angle for vulnerability, and dutch angle only for genuine instability or dread.",
  "Choose camera movement because it changes feeling: tracking for immersion, push-ins for pressure, whip pans for urgency, dolly zoom for psychological distortion.",
  "Motivate lighting. Keep the wide-shot lighting logic consistent in the coverage so the scene still feels like one world.",
  "Use long takes or tracking shots when immersion matters more than speed; use montage and close-up clusters when compression or ritual matters more than geography.",

  "No wall-to-wall music feeling in the image. Build visual breathing room and let moments of stillness reset the audience.",
